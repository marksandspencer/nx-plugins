# Contributing to @mands/nx-plugins

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing a new feature
- Becoming a maintainer

## We develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Contribute by making a Pull Request

A pull request is the best way to propose a change to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. Update the documentation if required
4. Ensure PR validation passes
5. Issue the pull request

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

When you submit a code change, your submission is understood to be under the same [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit)
that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub Issues

We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/marksandspencer/nx-plugins/issues) to track bugs. Report a bug by
[opening a new issue](https://github.com/marksandspencer/nx-plugins/issues/new).

### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Great bug reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports and this helps us to make sure we can address and prioritise bugs as efficiently as possible.

## Use a consistent coding style

We enforce a consistent coding style using linting rules. Please ensure that your code adheres to the project's linting rules and
avoid lint ignores.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under this project's MIT License.
